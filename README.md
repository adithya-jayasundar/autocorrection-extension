# Auto Correction Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension I built **from scratch** that provides real-time auto-correction while typing in any text field.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically corrects common typos and misspellings as you type  
- Lightweight and fast, running entirely in-browser  
- Customizable: easily add/edit replacement rules  
- Works with all websites and input fields

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Content script** listens to keyboard events in input/textarea elements  
2. Matches typed words against a typo dictionary  
3. Replaces incorrect words with the correct version on the fly  
4. Users can update the dictionary via the extension’s popup or settings
